## About Me :relaxed:

:wave: Hello, I'm Shekhar. A Design-minded Software Engineer focused on building beautiful interfaces & impactful digital products.

✨ I'm extremly good at one thing. And that's helping SaaS companies to solve problems by contributing my skills and build awesome products.

💻 During the day I'm a Software Engineer at a Startup. And in the evening I spend my time working on my own ideas or learning something new.

😇 I help newbie developers not to make the same mistakes that I've made

📢 Apart from speaking English and Hindi, I also know JavaScript and Python :relaxed:

❤️ Creating beautiful animation in web apps, designing websites and sometimes doing some Machine Learning is what I love. 

💡 I bring conceptual ideas to fully functional applications

💠 I'm great at designing and creating websites that needs cool animations with lots of unique features, and also building backend features
