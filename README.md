## About Me 😊

👋 Hey, I'm Shekhar — an AI-powered SaaS Innovator and Full Stack Engineer passionate about crafting scalable digital products.

🚀 I specialize in building intelligent, user-centric applications that blend performance, scalability, and delightful UI/UX.

💡 By day, I'm building Feeding Trends — turning vision into value through engineering and innovation. By night, I'm exploring AI integrations and nurturing bold ideas into real-world tools.

💻 I speak JavaScript and Python fluently — designing sleek frontends, building rock-solid backends, and bringing it all together into production-grade systems.

🧠 I'm deeply interested in the intersection of AI and software — from integrating LLMs into SaaS tools to experimenting with smart automation and personalized experiences.

🎨 I love creating smooth web animations, polished UIs, and seamless user journeys that feel as good as they look.

💠 Whether it's designing elegant user interfaces, optimizing backend logic, or turning ambitious ideas into MVPs — I bring it all to the table to build exceptional products.
